blogText:

<span class="drop-cap">M</span>ore recently I have taken to writing blog posts about things I find interesting. From technology and design to food and drink, as well as anything in between. Hot topics at the moment include DIY as I am going through a bit of a rennovation of a house as well as many things on web design and development as I learn them. I also include thoughts and tutorials on web design and development as I learn more.

Check out some of my most recent posts on the left or click the button to check out an index containing all of them.

<span class="drop-cap">R</span>ight now I am spending a lot of my time desinging beautiful things like websites to be displayed and viewed on the world wide web. I love to focus on making lightweight, responsive design which keeps users and customers engaged - whilst allowing the owners of the website to easily update the content in almost every way thinkable.

Have a look at some of my previous design work! Hovering and clicking on the image of a website will take you to it.
